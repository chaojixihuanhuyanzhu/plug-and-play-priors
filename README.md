# plug-and-play-priors
Code to experiment with different priors via de-noising algorithms for 2-D tomography. 

For testing, run the example file PlugAndPlayPriorScript.m

Many of the de-noising algorithms have been downloaded from their respective websites.If you use this work please cite the appropriate papers for them.  

If you use the P&P code, please cite:
